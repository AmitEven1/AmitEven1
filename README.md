# Hey, I'm Amit — Engineering the Future One Bit at a Time

Welcome to my digital lab. I'm a systems thinker, deep generalist, and relentless builder with a long-term vision:  
**to create technology that reshapes what it means to be human** — starting with embedded systems, and pushing toward the boundary between hardware, software, and biology.

## What I Do

- **Embedded Systems Development**  
  Writing low-level C, dancing with bits and registers. Currently working with STM32 + ICM20948 over I2C.  
  I like my code close to the metal and my abstractions earned.

- **PCB & Hardware Design**  
  Architecting intelligent systems from the ground up — schematics, layouts, signal integrity, and the spark of electrons across copper traces.

- **Self-Made Curriculum**  
  Studying as if I were designing my own multi-degree program.  
  Topics include:  
  - Advanced **Mathematics** & **Physics** (for those who seek to understand, not just calculate)  
  - **Computer Architecture**, **Low-Level Programming**, **Networking**, **DSP**, and **Radio Communication**  
  - **Professional English** for global-scale engineering impact

- **Legacy-Oriented Thinking**  
  Every project I build is a brick in a structure that outlasts me. I’m not here to optimize KPIs — I’m here to build systems that matter.

## I Believe In:

- **Truth over agreement** — if something doesn’t hold up under scrutiny, it doesn’t belong in the system.
- **Deep focus** — distractions are liabilities.
- **Intentional design** — in circuits, code, and life.

## Tech Stack (for now):

- **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Bash
- **Platforms:** STM32, ESP32, ARM Cortex-M
- **Protocols:** I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, Ethernet
- **Tools:** KiCad, STM32CubeIDE, Logic Analyzers, Oscilloscopes, Git

## Work in Progress:

- A real-time embedded system with full sensor integration (ICM20948), built for extensibility and precision.
- My own OS-level primitives for microcontrollers.
- Long-term: Systems that blur the line between biology and machines.

## Want to Collaborate?

If you're building something real — something that makes people stop and think — I’m interested.  
Let’s push the boundaries.
